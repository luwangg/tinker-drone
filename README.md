============

Sandbox for nodecopter hacking. Work In Progress.

## Installation

1. Install [Node](http://nodejs.org/). If you're on OSX, there's a handy pkg
   installer available on the node homepage. This is the recommended method of
   installation. (ie. homebrew)

2. Install the [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) CLI as a global node package.
   `npm install -g grunt-cli`

3. Install the dependencies for the project. From the root of this repo, run
   `npm install`. This will read the packages.json file and install packages
   into `./node_modules`.

4. To run locally run `npm install` then `grunt`. The service will be running
   on your local environment at http://localhost:2001.

## Development

Run `grunt` to get started.
